 * Gmail Snooze by Cezary Piekacz

 *
 * About
 * =====
 *
 * Gmail Snooze is a Google Apps Script which allows e-mail snoozing. It removes
 * e-mails marked by one of the labels from inbox and bring them back later at a
 * predefined time. It was inspired by the Mailbox application for iPhone.
 *
 * Installation
 * ============
 *
 * 1. Login to your Google Drive
 * 2. Create a new script
 * 3. Paste the code bellow
 * 4. Define your own labels and trigger hours in the SETUP section
 * 5. Save the script
 * 6. Click on 'Run > Install' in main menu, this will create labels in Gmail and
 *	  define the following triggers:
 *	    - cleanLabels - Time-driven - Minute timer - Every minute
 *	    - runEvening - Time-driven - Day timer - 18:00 - 19:00
 *	    - runTomorrow - Time-driven - Day timer - 6:00 - 7:00 (or earlier)
 *	    - runSaturday - Time-driven - Week timer - Every saturday at 6:00 - 7:00
 * 7. Authorize the script and grant access to Gmail
 *
 * Customization
 * =============
 *
 * You can change names of the labels as well as times at which events are fired.
 * To do that just edit the coresponing parameters in the SETUP section of the
 * script. You can also disable marking e-mail as unread after they are moved back
 * into inbox. To do that just set the markUnread parameter to false.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * When you want to snooze an email for one day, just mark it with label Tomorrow.
 * After one minute it will be removed from your Inbox and marked as read. The next
 * in the morning (at the time of you choosing), this script will bring this e-mail
 * back to your inbox and mark it as unread.
 *
 * Troubleshooting
 * ===============
 *
 * Sometimes you will receive an e-mail from Google saying that there was and error
 * running function cleanLabels and that it could not connect to Gmail. This is normal
 * so there is nothing to worry about. There is a backoff function implemented which
 * tries to connect several times in a row for about 30 seconds, but sometimes the
 * connection is refused by Gmail for a longer period of time. If you do not want to
 * receive these e-mails, you can turn them off in a Triggers for current project
 * window (click on a notifications link under the cleanLabels trigger).
